# General errors 


1. TypeScript reports an error (TS_ERROR) because "beyond-layout-children" is not recognized in JSX.IntrinsicElements.
    The idea is 

    - example file: \modules\layouts\main\ts\views\index.tsx
    - [github issue](https://github.com/beyondjs/widgets/issues/2)

2. The `widget` property is not being recognized inside the controller.
    - modules\layouts\main\ts\controller.ts
